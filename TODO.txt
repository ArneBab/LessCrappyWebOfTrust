- make identities into a link that you can click (go to showIdentity page)
- support deleting the link to an identity entirely
- support deleting properties from your own profile at will
- support changing the trust of an identity via the WoT
- Beautify HTML pages for various actions
- create page where you can search for an identity and go to its identity info page (listing all identities is CRAZY)
- check whether we can output evil HTML? (this would be bad)

- RELEASE FOR BETA TESTING

- fix link between getIdentitiesByScore and getIdentity, requires refactoring
- fix getIdentitiesbyScore inefficiency (optimize using graph db call)
- incremental score recomputation on identity update

FAR FUTURE:
- add event pushing framework thingy
- clean-up some vertices from the the WoT using some criterium
