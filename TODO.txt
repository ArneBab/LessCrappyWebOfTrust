- insert WoT XML file
- insert WoT XML files IF changes have been made to our own trust scores

- check whether we remove edges on an update? I think we're currently only increasingly adding them? NEVER remove vertices though...
- fix getIdentitiesbyScore inefficiency (optimize using graph db call)
- set score appropriately and efficiently for getIdentitiesByScore
 
- give each identity a score of 0 by default for the complete WoT
- incremental score recomputation on identity update
- don't update the identity if the retrieved edition isn't newer than the one we have already stored.

- create NEW ownIdentity using auto-generated keys
- view details about own identity on page (basically the same as normal identity, but with moar buttons)
- create page where you can search for an identity and go to its identity info page (listing all identities is CRAZY)
- Add controls for changing trust values AND even removing the connection to an identity entirely!
- Beautify HTML pages for various actions

- add event pushing framework thingy
