- check whether multiple identities in the graph store work as expected wrt trust calculation
- create page where you can search for an identity and go to its identity info page (listing all identities is CRAZY)
- Add controls for changing trust values AND even removing the connection to an identity entirely!
- Beautify HTML pages for various actions
- check whether we can output evil HTML?

RELEASE FOR BETA TESTING

- fix link between getIdentitiesByScore and getIdentity, the name checking is pure evil?
