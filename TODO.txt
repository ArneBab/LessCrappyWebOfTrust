- removeTrust doesn't work?

- check whether we remove edges on an update? I think we're currently only increasingly adding them? NEVER remove vertices though...
- give each identity a default trust value of 0 for the complete WoT when calculating the trust values
- create NEW ownIdentity using auto-generated keys
- test whether everything breaks and whether trust values for identities make sense (maybe trust digger3, but distrust a random identity, then check with Sone if they appear or not?)

- fix link between getIdentitiesByScore and getIdentity, the name checking is pure evil?
- view details about own identity on page (basically the same as normal identity, but with moar buttons)
-- this is the only case where we remove a vertex?
- create page where you can search for an identity and go to its identity info page (listing all identities is CRAZY)
- Add controls for changing trust values AND even removing the connection to an identity entirely!
- Beautify HTML pages for various actions

RELEASE FOR BETA TESTING

- fix getIdentitiesbyScore inefficiency (optimize using graph db call)
- incremental score recomputation on identity update


FAR FUTURE:
- add event pushing framework thingy
