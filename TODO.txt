- create identity sets dontinsert = true, but doesn't clear it so never an insert?
-- probably an artefact from identity restore
- Beautify HTML pages for various actions
- create page where you can search for an identity and go to its identity info page (listing all identities is CRAZY)
- Add controls for changing trust values AND even removing the (direct) connection to an identity entirely!
- check whether we can output evil HTML? (this would be bad)
- check whether multiple identities in the graph store work as expected wrt trust calculation

RELEASE FOR BETA TESTING

- fix link between getIdentitiesByScore and getIdentity, requires refactoring
- fix getIdentitiesbyScore inefficiency (optimize using graph db call)
- incremental score recomputation on identity update
- properly cancel requests, currentcurrentmodificationexception?

FAR FUTURE:
- add event pushing framework thingy
- clean-up some vertices from the the WoT using some criterium
