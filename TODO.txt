-update the request and (possibly) the insert ids with a new edition if we encounter it (thus rebuild it from the edition number)
-- current edition number looks okay..., but the URIs are outdated

- export own identity graph content as XML
- insert WoT XML file
- insert WoT XML files IF changes have been made to our own trust scores

- fix getIdentitiesbyScore inefficiency (optimize using graph db call)
- set score appropriately and efficiently for getIdentitiesByScore
 
- give each identity a score of 0 by default for the complete WoT
- incremental score recomputation on identity update

- create NEW ownIdentity using auto-generated keys
- view details about own identity on page (basically the same as normal identity, but with moar buttons)
- create page where you can search for an identity and go to its identity info page (listing all identities is CRAZY)
- Add controls for changing trust values AND even removing the connection to an identity entirely!

- add event pushing framework thingy
